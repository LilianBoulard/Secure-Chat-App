# Secure-Chat-App
A secure peer-to-peer communication app, inspired from [Ethereum Whisper](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Whisper)

It includes end-to-end encryption based on RSA/PKCS1_OAEP, AES256. All systems are based on security standards.

# Important note, as of April 22nd, 2020
This project is still a work in progress. You should not use the software right now ; come back in a few weeks for major improvements.

## Disclaimer
I am no cybersecurity expert. This project is more of a fun project for me to learn and explore rather than a production-ready solution.

If you wish to contribute, please fork this repo and/or send pull requests. Thank you :)
